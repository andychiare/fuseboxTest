# fuseboxTest

This code validates the possibility to dynamically load a compiled bundle by using [FuseBox](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box) as a bundler.
This example answers [my question posted on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50697890/loading-precompiled-bundles-at-runtime-in-a-js-application).

A huge thank you to [ngchanged](https://github.com/nchanged) for his unvaluable help.
